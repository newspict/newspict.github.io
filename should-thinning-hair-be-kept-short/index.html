<p>Cuts for thin hair are performed on both long and very short hair. As a rule of thumb, the darker the hair, the more difficult it is to see patches of scalp color of thinning hair underneath your roots. To get that thickness back, you�re going to have to regrow the hair from your root. Long layers will help add movement to your locks and will not take away too much body but rather add that extra bit of oomph. Short Curly Asymmetrical Bob Haircut for Fine Hair in 2020.</p>
