<p>I�m going to wait until my hair grows at least 3 more inches then i�ll consider a trim or cut to make it more even. If you have waves or curls, however, your hair may appear a bit shorter than it actually is. I�m not exactly sure of how to even it out, but personally im not going to cut a thing!! It�s a lot to think about, but fun to look at all of your options. Halima Khan Your Ultimate Hair Brush Guide First of all.</p>

<p>As the hair gets longer, it gets harder to measure them all the same without an assistant. Match the perfect length and style to your unique features. If you are choosing layers, then go for the asymmetrical cuts as it creates an illusion of the thicker, fuller, and voluminous hair. Then use shorter settings to blend the hair on the cheeks, neck and sideburns. Thin, straight hair + big forehead/longish face. Same.</p>
