<p>Yes, because eren is afflicted by ymir’s curse, which dictates that a titan shifter can only survive for 13 years after inheriting their powers. Attack on titan fans definitely did not expect eren to die at the end of the series. His death hasn’t been depicted in the anime series yet since it isn’t finished, but we have no doubt that it will come towards the conclusion of the anime’s final season; 80% of the human population has been killed, and eren knows that there is no way to be forgiven for committing something so grave. For fans, this could be a hard truth to deal with since we�ve been following his journey to avenge his parents� death and discover the world outside the walls from the very beginning.</p>

<p>Alright guys, here�s the deal about the ending we got, and bear with me: With the rumbling in tow, its later revealed that eren managed to kill off 80% of the world population.
