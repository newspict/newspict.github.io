<p>Grisha arrived in shiganshina and cured a plague in 832 and had eren with carla 3 years after his arrival. You almost certainly will not die on the year it says but you will likley die within ten years of its suggestion. Yes, because eren is afflicted by ymir’s curse, which dictates that a titan shifter can only survive for 13 years after inheriting their powers. All members of the titan race can only live for an additional 13 years after they awaken to their powers because the curse of ymir says that none of her descendants can live longer than she did. Any ordinary human would�ve died immediately from gabi�s shot, but eren�s titan power keeps him (barely) alive, so when zeke makes the catch (foreshadowed by his years of baseball practice in marley), the reunion still happens.</p>
