<p>Any ordinary human wouldï¿½ve died immediately from gabiï¿½s shot, but erenï¿½s titan power keeps him (barely) alive, so when zeke makes the catch (foreshadowed by his years of baseball practice in marley), the reunion still happens. Eren does not want to die without having accomplished anything and asks what he can do to be like reiner. Yes, because eren is afflicted by ymirâs curse, which dictates that a titan shifter can only survive for 13 years after inheriting their powers. Here, we can only reiterate that mikasa ackerman killed eren to stop the rumbling and to save the world, which eren himself confirms by stating that he had lost control and that he would have killed even more people had he not been stopped.
