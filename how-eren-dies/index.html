<p>No, eren does not die in ‘attack on titan’s episode titled ‘judgement.’. Currently, eren has not died in attack on titan. However, that answer varies by the end of the manga, but that is out of the scope of our current discussion. Attack on titan chapter 120, which is titled « an instant, » revealed what happened after gabi braun shot eren yeager in the neck that resulted in his head to be separated from his body. Why do people still argue Eren is the father after these.</p>
