<p>Where you choose to part your hair (side or middle) is largely a matter of personal preference, but it can make a difference for those who have features that are unbalancing or prominent on the face. This part is great for those with round faces, as it allows the hair to flow evenly on both sides of the face, elongating it. A middle part allows your locks to fall straight down the sides of your face, thus creating a more subtle cut along the jawline. Middle parts and deep side parts are super trendy but don�t always look natural for your hair. DIY hairstyle! Part your hair down the middle and start a.</p>

<p>I find that when my hair sits naturally it falls into this parting on its own. Still, if you�re determined to pull off this look, you can try a modified center part of sorts by sectioning your hair just slightly off center. After quite a few trials and many many errors i realized that the way you part your hair depends a lot on the shape of your face. The easiest trick in detecting your hair’s natural part is the forward and back method. How to Part Your Hair 9 Steps (with Pictures) wikiHow.</p>
