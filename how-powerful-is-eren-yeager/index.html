<p>Eren’s actions were out of desperateness to save his friends, even if it came at the cost of the whole world and his own life.

Now this comes to a range of abilities and skills he has accumulated, and to prove my point, i plan to pit eren against armin, his ‘friend’ (depends on the manga status quo). Attack on Titan Eren Yeager Good Smile Company.</p>
