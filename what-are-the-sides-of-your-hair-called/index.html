<p>It is considered a mohawk since the side(s) are shaved and the hair runs all the way down the back of the head. Tie back the rest of the hair into a pony tail so it�s out of the way and use vaseline as a barrier to the rest of the hair. The answer provided by @allinone gives good background on the etymology. The asymmetrical cut offers the right amount of risk and reward for those daring enough to try it. Pin on hair and beauty.</p>
