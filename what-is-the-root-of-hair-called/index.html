<p>The root of the hair is a place where body cells band together to form a protein that creates hair. You will not be able to see it unless you pluck the hair out of your head. The cells of this region have large central vacuole and peripheral cytoplasm and can thus absorb water and minerals from the soil. If you were to look at a diagram, the root would be the rounded part.</p>
