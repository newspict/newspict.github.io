So, the answer to this question is no, but we still don’t know the truth because the creator hajime isayama still yet to confirm the theory. All members of the titan race can only live for an additional 13 years after they awaken to their powers because the curse of ymir says that none of her descendants can live longer than she did. Mikasa only had feelings for eren throughout the main plot and it was only later, after time healed her wounds, that she managed to move on and start a family of her own. Will Eren and Mikasa End Up Together? Or Will Eren Marry.</p>

<p>At the time, her serenity seemed odd. Eren had seen the feelings of ymir from her memories, and he confirms that ymir was in love with fritz. Grisha saw a younger version of himself in eren and thus decided to entrust eren with his ideals because he didn’t have enough time (his 13 years were almost done). If jean truly did become her husband, then they have surely kissed, but if it wasn’t jean, the two of them probably never kissed. Will Eren and Mikasa End Up Together? Or Will Eren Marry.</p>
