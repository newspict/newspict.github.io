<p>The sh&amp;sh detangling hair brush is a favorite among moms and dads because it works well with brushing the hair, and it appeals to children�s love for all things bright and colorful. If you use too much product on curly hair it has the opposite effect and makes the curls too heavy and messy. This can be done on day old hair by parting the hair down the center, then creating to high ponytails on each side. Have regular trims so the ends stay even. I do my own passion twists, can anyone tell me how to make.</p>
