<p><strong>Is It Better To Wear Hair Up Or Down</strong>, We all have our own opinions about whether wearing your hair down prevents damage, or if it’s better to wear it up so as not to disturb the natural flow of waves and curls. You’re wearing a crown or other accessory. Before going to sleep, i recommend pulling hair into a loose braid or ponytail, she told well + good. The way you are feeling, the activities you have planned, and the current condition of your hair are all factors to consider when you decide how to wear your hair.</p>

<p>The reason why a higher percentage of men prefer hair down in my opinion is for 2 simple reasons. The chances of your hair staying in beautiful shape when it’s down is much lower than when your hair is up. Several cute hairstyles will allow your hair to be partially up, so you don’t have to be uncomfortable. Secure that with a slipsilk scrunchie, which are my favorite because they are gentle on the hair.</p>

<p>We all have our own opinions about whether wearing your hair down prevents damage, or if it’s better to wear it up so as not to disturb the natural flow of waves and curls. All comments are the sole possesion of the commenters and do not reflect the opinions or values of mcs. I definitely think hair up looks a bit more bridal and formal. As oppose to someone with short hair or hair in a bun which would most likely resemble a male head in most cases. Secure that with a slipsilk scrunchie, which are my favorite because they are gentle on the hair.</p>
