Valentina Romée in 2020 Korean hair color, Kpop hair From pinterest.com</p>
<p>Some companies have contracts that mandate plastic surgery, which is permanent… hair styles are small potatoes by comparison. I’ve always wondered whether idols choose their own hair colors or whether their stylists/company chooses it for them. Idols in their original black hair colour is always the best hair colour general i get that a lot of fans are excited when their idols try out different hair colours for every comeback and i understand that because it�s a refreshing change and also a way to make fans excited about their comeback but i sometimes wished they�d keep their original hair colour longer. Short hair or long hair doesn’t really matter if it’s black because it is much more attractive than dyed hair.</p>
