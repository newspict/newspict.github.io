<p>It was never a style to be around for too long. The mullet is apparently coming back as the hairstyle of 2021. The growth in mullet searches that started in 2019 has rocketed, indicating that more people are interested in the hairstyle, which will result in more people wearing mullets. In fact i’ve been seeing a few guys with them recently, a few other ufc guys. Mullets are back in style. Here are 12 of our favorite ones.</p>
