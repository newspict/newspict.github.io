<p>Funky hair colour for over 60s. This is still a flattering look, while keeping your hair light and voluminous. I do truly believe, even long grey or white hair can be equally elegant and very youthful. I have prepared many different colors and different hair styles for wavy, curly, straight, asymmetrical hairstyles and thin or thick. &quot;60 year old hair never looked so good!!! My monther is 60.</p>
