<p>The rumbling is perhaps one of the most defining events in modern shonen manga. How many titans has eren killed in human form. How many confirmed titan kills does eren have? Of course, that’s also because of his knowledge of the future and his limited lifespan. What does Mikasa saying she won�t kill eren mean&hellip;.</p>

<p>It�s one of the few instances where eren�s anger is completely justified. It is also unknown where he currently is as he has not appeared in the past few chapters. How many titan powers does eren have? That scene kinda sums it up, he sees one titan killing his friend and rushes into the fray without hesitation, hoping to kill a titan, and doesn�t pay attention to anything around him.

<p>Eren doesn’t want to wait for his years to end without a resolution. A flurry of events that had been occurring in the last few chapters and episodes suggested. Eren begins to act differently after realizing he will have to pass on his titan soon and he suddenly starts considering zeke�s plan to start the rumbling. 1 he kills innocent people in order to free himself and his island, eren ends up just like reiner and kills innocent people. He wants to end things now. Who has the saddest backstory of Attack on Titan? Quora.</p>
