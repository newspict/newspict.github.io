<p>I think its true that men find straight hair more appealing. It’s a wonder that there are any straight haired people in existence at all. It�s said to be the most preferred hair type, followed by wavy then curly :p straight is just sexier, often times healthier, shinier and they can run their hands/fingers through it. Personally i hate curly hair so its very rare i curl my hair. Pin by Dalana Gonzalez on Stuff for Lil Man Curly hair.</p>
