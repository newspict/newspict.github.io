<p>The deva cut focuses on either sculpting each curl by cutting it at an angle so the curl pattern is not disrupted or using a technique of cutting curl by curl. The devacut is created on dry hair so that the stylist knows exactly how your curls will look as they fall. If you want bangs in the front, ask your hairstylist to create some near the center of your face. If you are dying for a new style and have no clue what to do, then you may want to give the deva cut a try. 29 Best Images Deva Curl Natural Black Hair Best Deva.</p>
