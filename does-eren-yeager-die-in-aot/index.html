<p>Grisha takes eren into the forest and, as he gives him the key to the basement and instructs him to find it, by all means, he injects eren with a titan serum, triggering a transformation into a pure titan by eren. Since the manga has finished, it is unclear what happened to the titans after eren was killed. During the battle of trost district, eren is seemingly eaten and killed by a bearded titan. A flurry of events that had been occurring in the last few chapters and episodes suggested that eren had taken a turn into the dark side. Don�t die, Survive! — MANBUN ANIME EREN HERE WE COME!! 🔥.</p>

<p>The key to this is the founder, ymir fritz. So no, we do not think eren yeager is dead. Hence, unless there are plot twits at play, it looks like eren yaegar is indeed dead. He is a playable character in attack on titan: Attack on Titan eren in 2020 Eren jäger.</p>
