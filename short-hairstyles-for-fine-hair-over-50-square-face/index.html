<p>When it comes to short hairstyles for women with round faces and fine hair over 50 stick to the layered cuts that build height on top. Add softness to your style with a curly bob. Not only just that, the classic short bob hairstyle also looks amazing on. As always, we recommend a gentle curling wand wave or tousled look.
