<p>This is natural, so don’t be alarmed! Protective styles isn�t working for you? As your hair grows, styles like box braids or twists will loosen. Perhaps the reason why weaves and extensions have a bad reputation for damaging the hair is because they require diligent care, almost as if you were caring for your own hair, perhaps even more so.

<p>Hair weaves are a great protective style because they allow the hair to rest and simply grow without interruptions for months at a time. So, if you’ve had a protective style in for a month or two, you’ll likely see a good amount of shed hair when you detangle. Most of the time, when growing out your natural hair, you will notice an increase in your hair’s thickness before you notice much increase in length. Hair growth tends to follow a pattern.
