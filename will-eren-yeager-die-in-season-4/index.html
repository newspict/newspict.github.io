Let�s take an objective look at why we believe eren is still alive in season 4 of attack on titan: Well, the answer is both yes and no. The answer is, essentially they wanted to start the story where it was and that’s why eren’s age was increased but his injuries looked the same and he recovered his leg at the start of season 4.

<p>So no, we do not think eren yeager is dead. Adjectives such as evil have been used to describe him. Yes, because eren is afflicted by ymir’s curse, which dictates that a titan shifter can only survive for 13 years after inheriting their powers.
