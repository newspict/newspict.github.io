<p>Squeeze the hair between your file and centre finger, slide your fingers up or down to the length you need. Kitchen or nail scissors aren’t designed to cut hair, so the result will be a frayed cut that will only advance split ends. These scissors are as sharp as razor blades, not only cutting the hair with ease but also never causing split ends. Cut the hair at a point, with haircutting scissors, so it will not look gruff or lopsided. Mens Haircut 2 On Sides Scissors On Top.</p>
