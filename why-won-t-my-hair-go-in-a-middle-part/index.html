<p>In more stubborn cases, you might consider having a body wave performed on the hair to add just a touch of wave to the hair to help mask the parting in back. I am sorry to hear that your perm didn’t take the way it normally does, this is most likely caused by the change in products or the incorrect perm may have been used. If i am straigthening my hair with a flat iron (i have natural big curls/waves, similar to yours in the video), there is always one part on the back of my head where the hair won’t straigthen out at the top. Instead of combing your hair into a side part when it’s wet and then blow drying around the part you created, try blow drying your hair until it’s at least 50 percent. Why Won’t My Hair Grow? Part 2 Lustrous Henna®.</p>
