<p>How long men’s box braids last will include the following: The longer your braids stay in, the harder it might be to maneuver around the build up. Box braids last about four to six weeks if you care for them well. I�d recommend 6 to 8 weeks and if you want to go longer, you have to really take good care of it to avoid a lot of breakage. PS 🌿 Medium Long Box Braids Duration 🌿 5.56 hrs Last 🌿 Up.</p>
