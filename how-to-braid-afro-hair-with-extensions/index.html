<p>My all time fave for my own hair and extension choice is and will always be twist. This type of braid for black hair adds volume by braiding the hair extensions to the braids near the scalp. As extensions i chose kinky twist, as it matches my hair texture. Cover hair with a plastic cap or bag for about 10 to 15 minutes. Curly Crochet Hair Braiding Hair Ombre Grey bundles Jerry.</p>
