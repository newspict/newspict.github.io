<p>I was told by my black male friend to wait until j was at least a year to get his first haircut, or it would mess up the growth pattern of his hair, and make it generally scraggly/nappy from then on. Lol i love the way it looks but it definitely took away the baby look instantly. Keep in mind that every child is different and there is no certain age at which they need that first cut. Furthermore, your babies skull is probably not fully fused yet as the anterior fontanelle heals between the ages of 1 1/2 to 2 years old, so the overall look of his hair may not look too pleasing at the moment due to irregularities in the scalp that are corrected as the baby’s skull matures.

<p>Biracial babies� hair is usually less curly and they produce more oil, so if necessary, you can wash the hair twice a week. No, got to stick with genetics on this one, not the timing of your baby�s first haircut. Overwashing can strip away the natural oils of the scalp and leave hair dry, brittle, and frizzy.
