<p>Another hairstyle to cover bald spots is called the bob cut. If the strands are not close to the actual bald length, they will make a good show off on a brush back with tapered waves. The top part is given a clean look and parted to one side, and the sides are faded to create a contrast and hide the baldness. It occurs as a result of hair loss at the temples having advanced backward, hair loss at the crown having advanced forward, and the two merging in the middle to form a completely bald appearance on. Here Are The Best Hairstyles For Men With Thin Hair.</p>
