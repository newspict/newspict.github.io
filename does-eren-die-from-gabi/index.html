For fans, this could be a hard truth to deal with since we�ve been following his journey to avenge his parents� death and discover the world outside the walls from the very beginning. Little did she know that this would actually accelerate eren’s monstrous transformation. Will Gabi Die? Will Gabi Inherit a Titan? Will Gabi Eat Eren?.</p>

<p>So while eren probably isn�t dead, his death seems like it has to have a major impact on the story, if we�ve been following this girl around for the last 30 issues all to get to this moment. Does gabi shooting off eren�s head mean the death of his physical body in attack on titan? Eren has escaped death before and it’s possible for members of the titan race to rapidly heal themselves and even regrow entire limbs, but it doesn’t work this time as the final chapter of the manga confirms his death. For fans, this could be a hard truth to deal with since we�ve been following his journey to avenge his parents� death and discover the world outside the walls from the very beginning. Pin by littleL on Eren Jäger Eren jaeger, Attack on.</p>
