<p>Because zeke caught eren before he passed on, eren teleports to the paths, where zeke is waiting for him. Eren does not want to die without having accomplished anything and asks what he can do to be like reiner. In the newly released episode, fans can watch eren running toward his brother after he unleashed his titan attack, with the protagonist trying to outrun reiner once he managed to. Eren yeager, the hero of our story, seems to have turned into a villain. Does Eren Die in �Attack on Titan�? Who Did It and How Did.</p>

<p>Armin begins ridiculing eren, joking that mikasa will forget about him quickly, and eren finally breaks down and admits that he does not want mikasa to love anyone but him. In the first season of the show, eren was killed by a titan during a battle. Any ordinary human would�ve died immediately from gabi�s shot, but eren�s titan power keeps him (barely) alive, so when zeke makes the catch (foreshadowed by his years of baseball practice in marley), the reunion still happens. For fans, this could be a hard truth to deal with since we�ve been following his journey to avenge his parents� death and discover the world outside the walls from the very beginning. Don�t die, Survive! — Eren Yeager Snk season 3 Episode 2.</p>
