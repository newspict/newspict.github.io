<p>It is attained in the way of righteousness. 11:14 for a man to have long hair, carefully adjusted, is such a mark of effeminacy as is a disgrace to him. As long as the hair color does not diminish a christian’s testimony or reflection of jesus, there is nothing in scripture to imply we should not dye it. Paul is urging the corinthians to fit in with the culturally acceptable standards of male and female appearance. Did Jesus Have Long Hair.</p>

<p>For her hair is given her for a covering. She made him sleep on her knees, and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his hair. Doesn’t nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, berean literal bible does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him, king james bible doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? He says, “if you say they are both based on god’s created design, then you have to say long hair is wrong for men in every culture.” in other words, if they have the same meaning, and they refer to god’s created design, then you have to say that long hair on men and short hair on women are always wrong in every culture without exception.
